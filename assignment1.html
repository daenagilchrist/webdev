        <h1>This is the Main Heading</h1>
        <p>This text might be an introduction to the rest of the page. And if the page is a long one it might be split up into several sub-headings.</p>

        <hr/>

        <h2>This is a Sub-Heading</h2>
        <p>Many long articles have sub-headings so to help you follow the structure of what is being written. There may even be sub-sub-headings (or lower-level headings)</p>

        <h3>What should this be?</h3>

        <h4>Another Sub-Heading</h4>
        <p>Here you can see another sub-heading. But should this be a heading? Probably not. Too much info/text now. right?</p>

<!-- add a few "breaks" here to create some space! **hint** you can also use these to break sentences into new lines... as it was intended to be used! try using one in the middle of a paragraph and see what happens in your browser-->
<br/> <br/> <br/>
       <h5> And Another Sub-Heading</h5>
        <p>More headings?? Here you can see another sub-heading. You know what to do now. Let's use a proper tag. </p>

        <h6>Yet Another Sub-Heading</h6>
        <p>That's a lot of headings. Here you can see another sub-heading. You know what to do now.  Make this <b>WORD</b> strong aka bold. Give it a proper tag! </p>

<hr/><!-- add a long line here -->

<!-- add the proper tags to change "th" and "2" below -->

        <p>Today is the 4<sup>th</sup> of July and there is a lot of C0<sub>2</sub> in the air.</p>

<!-- try using the "abbr" tag just like it's used in the book for the line below --> 

        <p>In case you were wondering, here is <abbr title="Professor">Prof</abbr> John Doe's address!</p>

<!-- Make each line for the address appears on a new line, starting with the name -->

        <p>John Doe
